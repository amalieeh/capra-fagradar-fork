Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth.
Unlike traditional cloud computing architectures that centralize processing in data centers, edge computing processes data near the source of data generation, such as IoT devices, smartphones, or edge servers located near users.
This approach reduces latency, enhances the speed of data processing, and allows for real-time data analysis and decision-making.
Edge computing is particularly beneficial in scenarios where quick processing is critical or where connectivity to a central server is limited or expensive.
It supports a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles and smart cities to industrial IoT and augmented reality, enabling more efficient and intelligent systems.
