Feature toggles, also known as feature flags, are a software development technique that allows teams to modify system behavior without changing code.
By wrapping a new or existing feature in a toggle, developers can enable or disable that feature at runtime, typically through a configuration change.
This technique is used to facilitate a range of practices, such as A/B testing, canary releases, continuous deployment, and enabling trunk-based development by allowing features to be merged into the main branch even if they aren't ready to be released to end-users.
Feature toggles provide a powerful way to gradually roll out features, test in production, and quickly revert changes if issues arise, all without deploying new code.
They enable more flexible control over the software's functionality and user experience but require careful management to avoid technical debt associated with having too many toggles.
