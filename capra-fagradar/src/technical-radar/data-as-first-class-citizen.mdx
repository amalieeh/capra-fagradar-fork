Data as a first-class citizen in software engineering and data science is a concept emphasizing the importance of data quality,
accessibility, and interoperability in systems and applications.
This approach treats data with the same priority as code functionality, meaning that data is carefully designed, managed,
and utilized to ensure it is accurate, available, and usable across different parts of an application or system.
By prioritizing data in this manner, organizations can better leverage their data for decision-making,
ensure consistency and reliability across services, and create more adaptable and scalable systems.

The idea encourages practices such as comprehensive data governance, effective data management strategies,
and the use of standards to ensure data can be easily shared and processed across different platforms and environments.
