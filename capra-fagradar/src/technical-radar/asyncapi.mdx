AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative that provides a specification and a suite of tools to describe and work with asynchronous APIs.
It aims to standardize the definition of asynchronous APIs, much like OpenAPI does for synchronous REST APIs.
Asynchronous communication is common in event-driven architectures, where services communicate through events rather than direct requests and responses.
