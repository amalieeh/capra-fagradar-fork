A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
It organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns, with each row representing a record and each column representing a data field.
Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining, manipulating, and querying data.
They are based on the relational model, an intuitive and straightforward way of representing data in tables.
This model enables complex queries and transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency through constraints, relationships, and transactions.

Relational databases are widely used for a variety of applications,
from simple customer relationship management systems to complex financial systems,
due to their reliability, flexibility, and robust support for concurrent users and transactions.
