OpenID Connect (OIDC) is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and adds an authentication layer enabling clients to verify
the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server as well as to
obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

OIDC allows clients to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users.
In essence while OAuth 2.0 is about resource access and sharing OIDC is about user authentication.
