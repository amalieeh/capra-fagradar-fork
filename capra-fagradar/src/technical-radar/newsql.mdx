NewSQL is a class of modern relational database management systems that seek to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads while maintaining the ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of a traditional SQL database.
NewSQL databases are designed to overcome the limitations of traditional SQL databases in handling large volumes of transactions and data, particularly in distributed computing environments.
They often employ innovative architectures, such as distributed systems designs, to achieve high scalability, fault tolerance, and concurrency control, without sacrificing the relational model and the ability to use SQL for queries.
This makes NewSQL an attractive option for businesses that require the robust data integrity features of relational databases but also need to scale out to meet high performance demands.
