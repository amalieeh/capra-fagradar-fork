A time series database (TSDB) is a type of database optimized for storing and querying sequences of data points indexed by time.
It's specifically designed to handle time-stamped or time-series data â€” data that changes over time or is measured at successive points in time.
This includes a wide range of data types, such as metrics from IoT devices, application performance monitoring data, financial trading data, and many others.
Time series databases are built to efficiently collect, store, and query large volumes of temporal data, providing fast data ingestion rates and optimized queries for time-based analytics.
They support time-based queries, aggregation, and analysis across time intervals, making it easier to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies over time.
TSDBs are particularly useful in contexts requiring high write volumes and rapid queries over time-stamped data, such as monitoring systems, real-time analytics platforms, and historical data analysis tools.
Their ability to handle the scale and specificity of temporal data makes them a crucial component in modern data infrastructure for time-sensitive applications.
