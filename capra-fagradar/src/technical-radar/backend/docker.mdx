Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
By doing so, Docker ensures that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.
This approach simplifies the complexities of deploying and running software across different environments, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
Docker containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
Docker is widely used in the development, shipping, and running of applications, facilitating continuous integration and deployment processes.
