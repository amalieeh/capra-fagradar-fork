Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure that each part functions correctly.
A "unit" can refer to a function, method, procedure, module, or object in object-oriented programming.
The primary goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
This testing is typically done by developers themselves using automated testing frameworks, which allows for tests to be run frequently and consistently.
Unit testing helps identify bugs early in the development cycle, simplifies code refactoring, and serves as documentation for the codebase.
It is a fundamental practice in agile and test-driven development methodologies.
