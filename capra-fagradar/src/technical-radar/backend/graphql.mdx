GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.
Unlike traditional REST APIs that require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL enables clients to request exactly what they need, not more, not less.
It allows clients to aggregate data from multiple sources with a single API call.
The server then returns JSON formatted precisely as requested, making data retrieval more efficient.
GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them.
GraphQL has gained popularity for its efficiency and flexibility, offering a powerful alternative to the REST architectural style for developing web APIs.
