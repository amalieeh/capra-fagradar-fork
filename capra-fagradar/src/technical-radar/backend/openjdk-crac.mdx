OpenJDK CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) is an open-source project under the OpenJDK umbrella, aimed at enhancing Java applications' startup time and performance.
CRaC focuses on the concept of ""checkpoint/restore"": it allows a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to take a snapshot (checkpoint) of a running application's state and then restore from that snapshot in the future.
This capability significantly reduces startup times because the application can be quickly restarted from a checkpointed state rather than being initialized from scratch.
