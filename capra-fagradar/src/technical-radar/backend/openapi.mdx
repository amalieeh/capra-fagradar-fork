OpenAPI, formerly known as Swagger, is a specification for building APIs that allows for a standardized way to describe RESTful APIs.
This specification enables both humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service without accessing its source code or seeing any documentation.
An OpenAPI definition can then be used to generate documentation, client SDKs, and even server stubs in various programming languages.
This approach facilitates API development, testing, and integration, making it easier for developers to create and consume web services.
OpenAPI supports defining endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication methods, and other relevant API information, thus promoting clear communication, interoperability, and faster development cycles in the API ecosystem.
