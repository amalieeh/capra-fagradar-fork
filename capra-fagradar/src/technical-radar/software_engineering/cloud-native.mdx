Cloud-native refers to a set of practices and technologies used for building and running applications to take full advantage of cloud computing models.
This approach emphasizes scalable, elastic, and fault-tolerant designs that leverage managed services.
Cloud-native development typically involves using microservices architecture, containers, service meshes, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs.
These practices enable organizations to rapidly deploy, update, and scale applications across public, private, and hybrid clouds.
Cloud-native approaches foster agility, resilience, and portability across cloud environments,
facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes for faster development cycles and more robust systems.
