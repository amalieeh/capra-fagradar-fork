Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a methodology that centers on modeling software closely after the real-world domain it targets.
It emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a shared language, ensuring the software architecture and codebase reflect the specific complexities and rules of the domain.
DDD aims to produce more intuitive and adaptable software systems by prioritizing domain logic and structures over technical details.
