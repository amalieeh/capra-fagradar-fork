OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. It acts as an intermediary, providing tokens to applications after the user has approved access. This allows users to share their data from one site (like a social network or cloud storage) with another site or application without sharing their credentials. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and adds an authentication layer, enabling clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. OIDC allows clients to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. In essence, while OAuth 2.0 is about resource access and sharing, OIDC is about user authentication.
