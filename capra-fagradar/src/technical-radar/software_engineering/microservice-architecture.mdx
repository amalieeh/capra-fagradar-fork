Microservice architecture is a software development approach that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services,
each implementing a specific business function and communicating through well-defined APIs.
Unlike monolithic architectures where the entire application is built as a single unit,
microservices are small, independently deployable modules that work together to form the whole application.
This architecture allows for greater flexibility in using different programming languages and technologies within the same application,
easier scaling by deploying more instances of specific services as needed, and improved resilience, as the failure of a single service does not necessarily bring down the entire system.

Microservices also support organizational agility by enabling small,
cross-functional teams to own and evolve services independently,
thereby accelerating development cycles and facilitating continuous delivery and deployment.
