Continuous discovery is an iterative process in agile product development where teams regularly engage with customers or users to gather insights about their needs, problems, and behaviors.
This ongoing interaction helps inform and refine product features, priorities, and roadmap decisions.
By continuously integrating user feedback and data into the development cycle, teams can better align their products with user expectations and market demands, ensuring that the product evolves in a way that delivers real value.
Continuous discovery emphasizes learning and adapting quickly, allowing teams to respond to changes and opportunities more effectively and reduce the risk of developing features or products that don't meet user needs.
