Monitoring is the practice of collecting, analyzing, and displaying data about the system's operational state. It typically involves predefined metrics and logs that indicate the health of the system, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and request response times. Monitoring tools alert teams to problems or anomalies that could indicate issues needing immediate attention. Observability, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses monitoring but also includes the ability to explore and understand the system's state, especially in complex systems. It involves gathering detailed data like metrics, logs, and traces, which provide insights into the inner workings of the system and its performance. Observability allows teams to diagnose and solve problems that were not anticipated, by understanding how the system behaves and how its components interact.
