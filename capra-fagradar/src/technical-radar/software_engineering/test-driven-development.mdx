Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code.
The process follows a short, repetitive cycle: First, write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
The test should fail since the functionality doesn't exist yet.
Next, write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
Finally, refactor the code to improve its structure and clarity, ensuring all tests still pass.
This cycle is often summarized as red (write a failing test), green (make the test pass), and refactor (clean up the code).

TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence in the software's functionality,
as new features are developed with tests confirming they work as intended from the start.
