Performance testing is a type of software testing aimed at determining how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a certain load.
It involves simulating real-life user load scenarios to test the speed, scalability, and reliability of software applications.
Performance testing can identify bottlenecks, measure response times, throughput rates, resource utilization levels, and endurance under sustained use.
The goal is to ensure that the software meets the performance criteria and provides a good user experience under various conditions.
This testing is crucial for identifying and mitigating performance issues before a product goes live, helping to avoid potential downtimes and ensuring the system can handle expected traffic volumes.
