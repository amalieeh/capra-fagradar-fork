Data mesh is a decentralized approach to data architecture and organizational design, intended to overcome the limitations of traditional data management strategies that can struggle with scale, complexity, and agility in large organizations.
It treats data as a product, emphasizing domain-oriented ownership and accountability.
In a data mesh, data is managed and governed by the domain teams that produce it, making data more accessible and useful across the organization.
This approach promotes interoperability through a standardized communication protocol and encourages a culture of collaboration and self-service analytics.
Data mesh aims to create a scalable and flexible data architecture that supports rapid, data-driven decision-making and innovation by breaking down silos and democratizing data access.
