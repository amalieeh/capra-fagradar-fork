PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, robustness, and performance.
It supports a wide range of data types, including JSON, and offers features such as sophisticated query capabilities, transactional integrity, and concurrency without read locks.
PostgreSQL is designed to handle a variety of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many concurrent users.
It provides extensive support for SQL standards and offers many modern features: complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, updatable views, and stored procedures.
Its extensibility makes it a popular choice for developers who need a secure, scalable, and efficient database solution for their applications.
