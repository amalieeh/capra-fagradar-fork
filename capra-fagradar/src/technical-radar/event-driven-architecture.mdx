Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which components or services of the application are triggered by events.
These events can be actions by users, system triggers, or messages from other services.
In an EDA, events are emitted by event producers (which don't necessarily know what will be done with the event) and are handled by event consumers (which perform actions in response to the event, but don't necessarily know where the event came from).
This architecture promotes loose coupling between components, enabling more scalable, flexible, and resilient systems.
It's particularly well-suited for asynchronous operations, microservices architectures, and real-time data processing applications.
EDA facilitates the development of highly responsive systems that can easily adapt to changes or spikes in demand, by efficiently managing and reacting to streams of event data.
